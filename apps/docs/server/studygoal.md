## Introduction

The Goals module enables users to create, manage, and track their goals in a structured manner. Users can create different goal categories and associate goals with these categories. This allows for better organization and categorization of goals, making it easier for users to manage and work towards their objectives.

## Features

- **Goal Categories:** Users can create goal categories to group their goals based on different themes, such as personal development, health, career, etc.

- **Create Goals:** Users can create individual goals and associate them with specific goal categories.

- **View Goals:** Users can view their created goals and track their progress.

- **Goal Details:** Each goal can include a title, description, target date, and other relevant information.

- **Role-Based Access:** Users can have different roles that determine their access to certain features. For example, some features may require a premium membership.

- **Authorization and Authentication:** Only authenticated users can create goals, and access to specific features is controlled by user roles.

## API Routes

The following API routes are available for managing goals and goal categories:

- `POST /goal-categories`: Create a new goal category.
- `GET /goal-categories`: Get a list of all goal categories.
- `GET /goal-categories/:id`: Get details of a specific goal category.
- `PUT /goal-categories/:id`: Update details of a specific goal category.
- `DELETE /goal-categories/:id`: Delete a specific goal category.

Additional routes can be implemented as per your application's requirements.

## Authentication and Authorization

The Goals module leverages authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure that users have the appropriate access:

- **Authentication:** Users must be authenticated to create, view, or manage their goals.

- **Authorization:** Role-based authorization ensures that only users with certain roles can perform specific actions. For example, premium users may have access to advanced features.
